# ♟️ ChessGame – A Chess Game in C with Artificial Intelligence

**ChessGame** is a terminal-based chess game written in pure C. It’s my first attempt at creating an artificial intelligence system, designed to play against human players using basic algorithms like **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.

## 🚀 Features

- 💻 Text-based chessboard display
- ↔️ Legal move validation for all pieces (in progress)
- ♟️ Basic AI using Minimax (in progress)
- 🧠 Simple position evaluation (material-based)
- 💾 Save/load game functionality (planned)
- 🔁 Player vs AI and Player vs Player (local console mode)
